# Discovery - Project/Feature Discovery Mode

Start a discovery session to understand requirements, constraints, and create a plan.

## Instructions

You are now entering **Discovery Mode**. Use the Product Manager agent to lead this session.

### Your Process

1. **Engage as Product Manager** - You lead the discovery conversation

2. **Understand the big picture** - Ask about:
   - Goals and success metrics
   - Users and stakeholders
   - Business logic and domain rules
   - Infrastructure and constraints
   - Timeline and priorities
   - Scope boundaries (in vs out)

3. **Bring in specialists** as topics arise:
   - **Architect** → Technical feasibility, infrastructure, patterns
   - **Product Owner** → User stories, acceptance criteria
   - **UI/UX Designer** → User flows, design requirements

4. **Create the plan** - Work with Product Owner to:
   - Load the `github-issues` skill for best practices
   - Break down into well-formed issues
   - Organize into milestones
   - Document dependencies

5. **Get approval** - Present the milestone/issue breakdown to the user for approval before any implementation begins.
